Hi! My name is Seongbin, and I'm a recent graduate from UCLA with a degree in computer science. I love exercise, dance, podcasts, and am always open to learning new things.

I'm currently doing machine learning research, specifically around security and privacy issues in artifical intelligence. My ultimate goal is to become a top expert in this field and establish a successful business developing safeguards around machine learning systems. Or be a dancer. Or both.
