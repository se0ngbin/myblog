Hi! My name is Seongbin, and I'm currently at UCLA majoring in CS. I love exercise, dance, podcasts, and am always open to learning new things. 

I'm interested in the [start up](mytraces.org) space, backend engineering, and machine learning[^1]. My goal is to establish a successful start up backed by powerful ideas and machine learning models.

Check out my [website](https://seongbin.me) for a portfolio.



[^1]: the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) course helped me a lot on my machine learning journey; go check it out!
